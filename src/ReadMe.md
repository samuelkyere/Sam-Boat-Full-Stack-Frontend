E-COMMERCE Full Stack PROJECT As at 2019, there were 2.06 million Africans living in the Bronx,1.202 million, New York, some have access to their native products at special places while others do not. And yet they all need or use products from their countries. At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, it has become very unsafe to go to crowded places like supermarkets and other shops. On the otherhand the E-commerce business was/is booming and has become very successful in the pandemic, but there was one issue that still needed to be addressed.

React Was Used For the frontend of this Project; I used two third party API's and they are: https://mod2-countdown.herokuapp.com/?search_term=${searchHistory} http://api.timezonedb.com/v2.1/get-time-zone?key=VF4D9XZWJ4CT&format=json&by=zone&zone=America/New_York I used Axios to fetch my API in App.js I made one parent component and eight children components in it I used useReducer and useContext hooks to pass down State in the ProductForm.js I also used react router to make routes in APP.js, and also made the links in Nav.js
